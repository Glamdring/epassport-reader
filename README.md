# epassport-reader
A sample android app that reads ICAO BAC-enabled e-passports, using the [jMRTD](http://jmrtd.org/) library

The app relies on hardcoding the passport number, date of birth and expiry date. It can be extended to provide UI for entering them.

Note that other apps exist that are more user-friendly, like [NFC Tag Info](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.mroland.android.apps.nfctaginfo)
and [NFC Passport Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.innovalor.nfciddocshowcase), but their source is not available
and therefore cannot be used as learning material.
